# Weather Radio Streaming

Our server has a way to stream NOAA Weather Radio, along with WeatherRadio Canada, on our site with GitHub Pages!

This is a custom and also a online way to use that for 24/7 a day weather info!

You should note the following below:

---

**This Audio Stream Player should not be used for protection of life or property.**

The most recent list and status may not reflect real-time stream availability within the NWROrg nexus. Please remember that you should NOT rely on this Internet audio to receive watches or warnings. This stream player may serve as a proactive resource - a "pre-alert" preparation tool.

You should have your own dedicated NOAA or Environment Canada Weather Radio receiver which will alert you 24 hours a day with appropriate audio and/or visual outputs.

## When seconds may count!

The audio may have a buffer delay as long as thirty seconds, plus any provider, network, or local stream delays. A small number of streams are 'Not Live' but recorded forecast statements from specific Weather Forecast Offices, such as NHC, MIA, MRX, etc. Such audio may not serve as an authoritative source for immediate impact warnings or advisories. In some events, such as Tornado Warnings, Network and other delays of several seconds may change your status from "Safe" to "Not Safe".

Additionally, a stream may be offline for various reasons when you may need it the most.

*It is "best practice" to always rely on NOAA/EC receivers with battery back-up.*

Also to note that some stations or the source of file streaming may be from different sources on the other hand as well!

We don't have the info on the streaming ourselfs at this time, so please be aware on what the streaming is coming from, when ever they come from, are not ours, and thus to be easier instead of hosting here on GitHub!
